# node-red-contrib-cul

Input, output, and configuration nodes to use the Busware CUL in node-red.

### Credits

Forked from (deprecated?) repo [https://github.com/1stsetup/node-red-contrib-cul](https://github.com/1stsetup/node-red-contrib-cul). Fixes some trivial bugs which render the original version defunct on current node-red/node.js versions.
